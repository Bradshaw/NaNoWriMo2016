# NaNoWriMo2016

This is an entry to NaNoWriMo 2016, I will be writing (hopefully) 50'000 words over the course of this month, that's 1'667 words a day. If I give myself an hour per day, that roughs out to 27 words per minute, which is well within my typing capacity, but I'm not sure I will know what to write.   
   
## The Story

As it stands, I don't know what the story is going to be about yet. Maybe a little bit of techfear, music, sexual frustration, badthoughts, and other random stuff...
