# Chapter One

Her mouth shoved right into my ear, "I'm so high right now that I can see the music".  
Oh, so that's what's she's been trying to say. I guess trying to get anything meaningful out of someone when you're standing in front of a set of speakers isn't a great idea. I'll never learn though. I wonder what it's like to be so high that you can see the music.  
I throw her a smile, she doesn't need to know I don't take drugs. Everyone takes drugs here, it's just assumed.   
  
I move back toward the speaker, stick my head almost inside it, and try to get back into the flow. This DJ is shit though, not that I could do better, but there's a reason I'm not standing on the stage. The tune is good, but I can hear the off-tempo drums in the back as he cack-handedly fumbles around trying to line up the transition.   
  
Fuck it.   
  
I walk outside. Chill hits my chest, I was sweating in there. I unwrap the sweater from my fist and slip it on. Where's Kreug?   
   
"Hey"  
Kreug looks up, he's got that stupid grin on his face. I can't remember what he takes, probably some mix of pills.   
"Oh, hey. So, you going to fuck her?"  
Fuck you, Kreug. "I don't know, Kreug, she's high as fuck."   
   
I slump down on the grass, try to prop my head against the tree stump. There's Ursa Major, I think. The one with the three stars in a row is Ursa Major, right? I like how precise the light from stars are. No clouds, we're shielded by the hills, not too much light pollution from the city. My ears feel like they're in a pillow, everything sounds a little numb. The ground has a little vibration to it on each kick. It's meaningless, you know? Moving about in rhythm, why? it's just loud sounds, and we just move to the pattern, and it makes us feel *good*, why? I think it has something to do with sex, maybe? Sex is about moving, sort of. And moving in some kind of "togetherness". Maybe we're all having some kind of proto-sex in there. Our bodies all sweating together, moving. We're all connected, touching, skin to skin, bouncing off each other. We overload every single sense, ears fucked the drums, bodies massaged by the synthesisers and basslines, eyes licked by the flashing lights. Throughout the night, the room warms up, all of us slowly working our way towards hours upon hours of some weird kind of musically-fueled tantric orgasm.   
   
Maybe that's why I'm sort of out of it now. This DJ is shit. Accidentally sticking his tongue into nostrils or something.   
   
I'd like to fuck her. She's hot, I think. She was dancing. I liked that. She got pretty close to me too. I think she was just trying to get closer to the speakers too. Or maybe she's into me? I could totally fuck her. She's probably going to come out here at some point, sit next to me and start kissing me. I'd move one hand up to her face, with her cheek nestled in my palm and my fingers holding the back of her neck. I guide her towards me, we're breathing into each other's mouths, her chest pushes up against mine, her leg moves forward and brushes against my dick. I hadn't realised how hard I'd gotten already
