Her mouth shoved right into my ear, "I'm so high right now that I can see the music".  
Oh, so that's what's she's been trying to say. I guess trying to get anything meaningful out of someone when you're standing in front of a set of speakers isn't a great idea. I'll never learn though. I wonder what it's like to be so high that you can see the music.  
I throw her a smile, she doesn't need to know I don't take drugs. Everyone takes drugs here, it's just assumed.
