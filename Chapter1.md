# Chapter One

Her mouth shoved right into my ear, "I'm so high right now that I can see the music".  
Oh, so that's what's she's been trying to say. I guess trying to get anything meaningful out of someone when you're standing in front of a set of speakers isn't a great idea. I'll never learn though.  
I throw her a smile, she doesn't need to know I don't take drugs. Everyone takes drugs here, it's just assumed.   
  
I move back toward the speaker, stick my head almost inside it, and try to get back into the flow. This DJ is shit though, not that I could do better, but there's a reason I'm not standing on the stage. The tune is good, but I can hear the off-tempo drums in the back as he cack-handedly fumbles around trying to line up the transition.   
  
Fuck it.   
  
I walk outside. Chill hits my chest, I was sweating in there. I unwrap the sweater from my fist and slip it on. Where's Kreug?   
   
"Hey"  
Kreug looks up, he's got that stupid grin on his face. I can't remember what he takes, probably some mix of pills.   
"Oh, hey. So, you going to fuck her?"  
Fuck you, Kreug. "I don't know, Kreug, she's high as fuck."   
   
I slump down on the grass, try to prop my head against the tree stump. There's Ursa Major, I think. The one with the three stars in a row is Ursa Major, right? I like how precise the light from stars are. No clouds, we're shielded by the hills, not too much light pollution from the city. My ears feel like they're in a pillow, everything sounds a little numb. The ground has a little vibration to it on each kick from the music indoors. It's meaningless, you know? Moving about in rhythm, why? it's just loud sounds, and we just move to the pattern, and it makes us feel *good*, why? I think it has something to do with sex, maybe? Sex is about moving, sort of. And moving in some kind of "togetherness". Maybe we're all having some kind of proto-sex in there. Our bodies all sweating together, moving. We're all connected, touching, skin to skin, bouncing off each other. We overload every single sense, ears fucked by the drums, bodies massaged by the synthesisers and basslines, eyes licked by the flashing lights. Throughout the night, the room warms up, all of us slowly working our way towards hours upon hours of some weird kind of musically-fueled tantric orgasm.   
   
Maybe that's why I'm sort of out of it now. This DJ is shit. Accidentally sticking his tongue into nostrils or something.   
   
I'd like to fuck her. She's hot, I think. She was dancing. I liked that. She got pretty close to me too. I think she was just trying to get closer to the speakers too. Or maybe she's into me? I could totally fuck her. She's probably going to come out here at some point, sit next to me and start kissing me. I'd move one hand up to her face, with her cheek nestled in my palm and my fingers holding the back of her neck. I guide her towards me, we're breathing into each other's mouths, her chest pushes up against mine, her leg moves forward and brushes against my dick. I hadn't realised how hard I'd gotten already. Suddenly I feel her hand feeling towards my crotch. She moves out from the kiss just a second, a smirk on her lips. She takes my hand and...
   
Wait, where would we go? The bushes? Yeah, right. Not the fucking toilets, the floor is covered in piss in there.   
   
"I'm going back in" Kreug is standing, towering above me. "You know where the others are?"  
Cel was dancing with an old friend, I don't know him. Paul and Giger slipped to the back at one point, I think they found someone to sell them shrooms. Beck was probably near me when the girl was trying to talk to me, but I wasn't paying attention.  
"No, they're in there somewhere."  
"This DJ is shit"  
"Yeah... I think his set is almost over though"  
"I hope so"   
   
I pull myself up. Kreug is still towering above me, his long skinny body puts his shoulders above my eyeline. He scans around, I imagine a searchlight coming out of his face, like a guard tower. What's he looking at? There are quite a lot of people outside. They'll move back indoors when the next DJ starts. We can get a nice spot near the speakers if we go in now.  
"Go?"  
"Go"   

As we walk back inside the building, I pre-emptively take my sweater off, grab one of the sleeves, start wrapping it around my hand, then when it's all bundled up, I tuck the other sleeve in and push it into my fist. I wonder where everyone else puts their clothes when they're dancing. I do this wrapping thing, I probably look like MegaMan, or a kid pretending to be MegaMan. We cross the threshold, I can feel the ground trembling under my feet, I'm probably imagining that, right? It's loud.  
The DJ is in a sort of nest, all around him there are painted canvases, probably some kind of special paint that's meant to light up properly under the black lights. The nest is tucked in the corner between two large speaker stacks. The room is emptier than before, but people are still pushed up to the bass bins, doing the obligatory side-to-side raver-bounce dance. There are more speaker stacks, a few lined up against one of the walls, one in each other corner, some extra bass bins have people sitting on them.  
A second person enters the nest, taps the DJ on the shoulder, they nod to each other. A few minutes later the handoff is done.  
The new DJ has moved the sound onto a low rumble, no drums, no melody, at first. A distorted voice is talking about aliens, something implying that they will soon contact us and share some cosmic knowledge that will change humanity forever. As the monologue goes on, synth stabs gradually build up into something ressembling a tune. This track is going to be good. I push my way to the speaker in the corner, put my head in the horn of the subwoofer, and grab hold onto it with my free hand. I close my eyes, my t-shirt is shivering on my shoulders.  
"And with their help, we will become gods"   
   
The music tears into me, each kick drum compressing my skull
