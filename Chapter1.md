# Chapter One

Her mouth shoved right into my ear, "I'm so high right now that I can see the music".  
Oh, so that's what's she's been trying to say. I guess trying to get anything meaningful out of someone when you're standing in front of a set of speakers isn't a great idea. I'll never learn though. I wonder what it's like to be so high that you can see the music.  
I throw her a smile, she doesn't need to know I don't take drugs. Everyone takes drugs here, it's just assumed.   
  
I move back toward the speaker, stick my head almost inside it, and try to get back into the flow. This DJ is shit though, not that I could do better, but there's a reason I'm not standing on the stage. The tune is good, but I can hear the off-tempo drums in the back as he cack-handedly fumbles around trying to line up the transition.   
  
Fuck it.   
  
I walk outside. Chill hits my chest, I was sweating in there. I unwrap the sweater from my fist and slip it on. Where's Kreug?   
   
"Hey"  
Kreug looks up, he's got that stupid grin on his face. I can't remember what he takes, probably some mix of pills.   
"Oh, hey. So, you going to fuck her?"  
Fuck you, Kreug. "I don't know, Kreug, she's high as fuck."   
   
I slump down on the grass, try to prop my head against the tree stump. There's Ursa Major, I think. The one with the three stars in a row is Ursa Major, right? I like how precise the light from stars are. No clouds, we're shielded by the hills, not too much light pollution from the city. My ears feel like they're in a pillow, everything sounds a little numb. The ground has a little vibration to it on each kick. It's meaningless, you know? Moving about in rhythm, why? it's just loud sounds, and we just move to the pattern, and it makes us feel *good*, why?
