# Chapter One

Her mouth shoved right into my ear, "I'm so high right now that I can see the music".  
Oh, so that's what's she's been trying to say. I guess trying to get anything meaningful out of someone when you're standing in front of a set of speakers isn't a great idea. I'll never learn though. I wonder what it's like to be so high that you can see the music.  
I throw her a smile, she doesn't need to know I don't take drugs. Everyone takes drugs here, it's just assumed.   
  
I move back toward the speaker, stick my head almost inside it, and try to get back into the flow. This DJ is shit though, not that I could do better, but there's a reason I'm not standing on the stage. The tune is good, but I can hear the off-tempo drums in the back as he cack-handedly fumbles around trying to line up the transition.   
  
Fuck it.   
  
I walk outside. Chill hits my chest, I was sweating in there. I unwrap the sweater from my fist and slip it on. Where's Kreug?   
   
"Hey"  
Kreug looks up, he's got that stupid grin on his face. I can't remember what he takes, probably some mix of pills.
